### Welcome to Nigerian Schools Directory GitHub Page

This project is a part of the 3mtt programme and is dedicated to serving as a comprehensive repository of information for all primary and secondary schools in Nigeria.

Our objective is to streamline access to school-related information. Presently, there is a lack of a centralized source for finding information on all schools in Nigeria. We aim to close this gap.
